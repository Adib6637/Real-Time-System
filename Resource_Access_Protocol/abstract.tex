In hard real time system, it is important to ensure every single task not only to be successfully executed but to produce the right value on the right time. Thus, scheduling algorithm play a big role in handling various of task. It is common in real time system environment, some tasks share the same resource. To maintain system predictability, every concurrent operating system should use effective synchronization to guarantee mutual exclusion among competing tasks, which is important especially when safety is a crucial part.This synchronization mechanism spawned another problem  in real time system which is \textit{priority invention} that bring many implications. This is why one of the most significant topics in developing a real-time system to handle the problem is resource access protocol. In this paper, I will describe two resource access protocols for uniprocessor that were created under fixed priority assignment and are used to handle a specific problem that arises when two or more tasks share a resource.
