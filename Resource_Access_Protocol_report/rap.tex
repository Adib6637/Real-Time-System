\section{Resource Access Protocol}

Now we will discuss 2 main resource access protocol for scheduling algorithm handling periodic tasks which are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Non-Preemptive Protocol
\item Highest Locker Priority

\end{itemize}

The first protocol is only for non-preemprtive scheduling and the second protocol is for preemtive scheduling. The following list are the important notation that I will use in explaining each protocol. The main idea about those protocols is to avoid priority invention, so that the blocking time experienced by the task that have the highest priority by lower priority task will also be discussed for each protocol.

\begin{itemize}
\item $ B_{i} $ denotes the maximum blocking time task $ \tau_{i} $ can experience.
\item $ z_{i,k} $ denotes a generic critical section of task $ \tau_{i} $ guarded by semaphore $ S_{k} $.
\item  $ Z_{i,k} $ denotes the longest critical section of task $ \tau_{i} $ guarded by semaphore $ S_{k} $.
\item $ \delta_{i,k} $ denotes the duration of $ Z_{i,k} $.
\item $ z_{i,h} \subset z_{i,k} $ indicates that $ z_{i,h} $ is entirely contained in $ z_{i,k} $.
\end{itemize}

%\item $ \sigma_{i} $ denotes the set of semaphores used by $ \tau_{i} $.
%\item $ \sigma_{i,j} $ denotes the set of semaphores that can block $ \tau_{i} $, used by the lower-priority task $ \tau_{j} $ .
%\item $ \gamma_{i,j} $ denotes the set of the longest critical sections that can block $ \tau_{i} $, accessed by the lower %priority task $ \tau_{j} $ . That is,
%\begin{center}
%$ \gamma_{i}=\{Z_{j,k} | P_{j}<P_{i}$ and $(S_{k}\geq \sigma_{i,j}) \} $
%\end{center}
%\item $ \gamma_{i}$ denotes the set of all the longest critical sections that can block $ \tau_{i} $. That is,
%\begin{center}
%$ \sigma_{i} =\underset{j:P_{j}>P_{i}}{\cup} \gamma_{i,j}$
%\end{center}
