\section{Resource Access Protocol}

Now we will discus 4 main resource access protocol for periodic task which are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Non-Preemptive Protocol
\item Highest Locker Priority
\item Priority Inheritance Protocol
\item Priority Ceiling Protocol
\end{itemize}


The first protocol is for non-preemptive-able schedule the the last three are for . The following list are the important notation that I use in explaining each protocol. The main idea about those protocol is to avoid priority invention, so that the blocking time experienced by the task that have highest priority by lower priority task could be reduced. Before I explaining the protocols, here are some notation that need to be understood.

\begin{itemize}
\item $ B_{i} $ denotes the maximum blocking time task $ \tau_{i} $ can experience.
\item $ z_{i,k} $ denotes a generic critical section of task $ \tau_{i} $ guarded by semaphore $ S_{k} $.
\item  $ Z_{i,k} $ denotes the longest critical section of task $ \tau_{i} $ guarded by semaphore $ S_{k} $.
\item $ \delta_{i,k} $ denotes the duration of $ Z_{i,k} $.
\item $ z_{i,h} \subset z_{i,k} $ indicates that $ z_{i,h} $ is entirely contained in $ z_{i,k} $.
\item $ \sigma_{i} $ denotes the set of semaphores used by $ \tau_{i} $.
\item $ \sigma_{i,j} $ denotes the set of semaphores that can block $ \tau_{i} $, used by the lower-priority task $ \tau_{j} $ .
\item $ \gamma_{i,j} $ denotes the set of the longest critical sections that can block $ \tau_{i} $, accessed by the lower priority task $ \tau_{j} $ . That is,
\begin{center}
$ \gamma_{i}=\{Z_{j,k} | P_{j}<P_{i}$ and $(S_{k}\geq \sigma_{i,j}) \} $
\end{center}
\item $ \gamma_{i}$ denotes the set of all the longest critical sections that can block $ \tau_{i} $. That is,
\begin{center}
$ \sigma_{i} =\underset{j:P_{j}>P_{i}}{\cup} \gamma_{i,j}$
\end{center}
\item
\end{itemize}
