Scheduling algorithm is important in real time operating system to handle various of tasks. Some tasks share the same resource, which is one of the complicated part in concurrent operating system. Any concurrent operating system should utilize proper resource access protocols to assure mutual exclusion among competing activities, in order to ensure consistency of data structures in exclusive resources. In this research paper, various of resource access protocol will be compared based on their characteristics. So, it will be clear for us which protocol should be implemented based on the environment that we are working on.
