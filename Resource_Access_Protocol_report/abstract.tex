In real time system, it is important to ensure every single task not only to be successfully executed but to produce the right value on the right time. Thus, scheduling algorithm play a big role in handling various of task, either statically or dynamically. It is common in real time system environment, some tasks share the same resource, which is one of the complicated part in concurrent operating system. Any concurrent operating system should utilize proper synchronization to assure mutual exclusion among competing activities, in order to ensure the predictability of the system, which is important in oder to produce reliable system especially when safety is a crucial part. This is why resource access protocol one of the important topic in building a real time system. In this research paper, various of resource access protocol for uni-processor will be compared based on their characteristics. So, it will be clear for us which protocol should be implemented based on the environment that we are working on. To ensure this paper is easy to understand, I also include basic information about real time system before going deep into resource access protocol.
