\section{Introduction}

Before we start, first we need to make sure the reader could understand the concept and terms used in this paper. Hence it is essential to explain them. We will start with the definition of the real time system..\par 

Real Time System - A system whose response time and delay time are deterministic without uncertainty and non-reproducibility and has an internal configuration that makes the worst value predictable or makes it easy to produce an educated guess value\cite{b1}.\par

A real-time system must have the ability to not only process data in a defined, predictable time frame but also ensure that critical tasks, such as safety-related workloads, are completed prior to less critical tasks\cite{b2}.

So, the main key features that a real time system must have is the predictability of the system to ensure its capability to produce the right result in the right time . We will discuss more about predictability because this is one of the main reasons the need of resource access protocol, so that a task doesn't miss its deadline to produce the right result.\par

In the next section I will explain further important concept and terms within the scope of this paper in more detail.
