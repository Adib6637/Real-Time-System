\section{Introduction}

Before we start, first we need to make sure the reader have basic knowledge about Real Time System. Hence it is essential to explain a basic term and concept that will be used in this research paper. We will start with the definition with the real time system since this protocol are for real time system.\par 

Real Time System - A system whose response time and delay time are deterministic without uncertainty and non-reproducibility and has an internal configuration that makes the worst value predictable or makes it easy to produce an educated guess value\cite{b1}.\par

So, according to Intel\cite{b2}-For a real-time system to be capable of real-time computing, it must satisfy two requirements:\par
\begin{itemize}
\item Timeliness: The ability to produce the expected result by a specific deadline.
\item Time synchronization: The capability of agents to coordinate independent clocks and operate together in unison.
\end{itemize}

A real-time system must have the ability to not only process data in a defined, predictable time frame but also ensure that critical tasks, such as safety-related workloads, are completed prior to less critical tasks\cite{b2}.

So, the main key that distinguish between the real time system and non-real time system is the predictability of the system. We will discuss more about predictability in upcoming subtopics.\par
