\subsection{Resource}

From a process point of view, a resource is any software structure that can be used by
the process to advance its execution. Typically, a resource can be a data structure, a
set of variables, a main memory area, a file, a piece of program, or a set of registers of
a peripheral device and resource dedicated to a particular process is said to be private,
whereas a resource that can be used by more tasks is called a shared resource.\cite{b5}

To maintain data consistency, many shared resources do not allow simultaneous accesses by competing tasks, but require their mutual exclusion, this means that a task cannot access a resource R if another task is inside R manipulating its data structures and in this case, R is called a mutually exclusive resource. A piece of code executed under mutual exclusion constraints is called a critical section.\cite{b5}
